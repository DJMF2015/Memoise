# Memoizer

Write a memoization function, which takes one function as a parameter and returns a memoized version of it. 
The type signature of the memoized function should match that of the input function. 
The memoized function should be able to cache its return values internally and return the cached values in case it has been called with parameters previously used saving processing time.
